# About Me: Let's protect the ocean with Robots !
**Marine Robotics Perception**, **(Opti-Acosutic) SLAM**, **Enhanced Scene Awareness**, \\
**Autonomous Ecosystem Monitoring**, **Ocean Science**


I'm a **PhD Student** of the [Marine Robotics Team](https://www.lirmm.fr/equipes/rsm/) (RSM), 
at the [Laboratory of Informatics, Robotics and Microelectronics of Montpellier](https://www.lirmm.fr/) (LIRMM), advised by Vincent Creuze, Juliette Drupt and Frederic Comby. 
My **PhD thesis** is entitled "*Mapping and monitoring of the surface condition and biological colonization of submerged parts of offshore wind turbines using acoustic imaging*". 

My current research project focuses on (opti-)acoustic localization and mapping of underwater robots near floating wind turbines, integrating semantic information.

With the widespread development of floating offshore renewable structures, the high cost and 
risk of human-based inspection and maintenance must be addressed.
Moreover, these structures become artificial reefs due to the colonization of many sessile animals 
(biofouling). Monitoring biodiversity and the effects of these "artificial" ecosystems on the whole 
marine environment is crucial. 
To address these problems efficiently, autonomous (AUV) and teleoperated (ROV) underwater vehicles are the best choice. 
Nevertheless, before deploying these systems, it is fundamental to guarantee
their robustness in localizing themselves, mapping the environment, and understanding it.
Acoustic imaging sensors provide additional eyes on the marine world, 
where optical sensors (cameras) often have degraded performance. 
However, the resolution and interpretability of acoustic images are challenging factors that I 
will address during my research. 
Finally, finding optimal ways to fuse optical images with acoustic ones allows us to achieve 
an enhanced understanding of the scene, with additional robustness and information.

I received my Bachelor (2019-22) and Master (2022-25) degrees in **Automation and Control Engineering** at Politecnico di Milano. \\
During my Master's studies I spent 5 months in Japan at Tohoku University (read [my feedback](https://www.ccsatm.polimi.it/alessandro-puglisi-tohoku-univeristy-sendai-japan/?lang=en)), as an exchange student and a research member
of the [Space Robotics Lab](https://astro2.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/en/) (SRL). 
I was a member of the Rover Team, working on a joint project with the Limbed Team. 
My research project involved a Prototype Multi-Modal Multi-Limbed Space Robot ([report videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFgoOtxCJKTPv_dibdvSUT_YPGDJBc_5C&si=o7Ic9U2FwktZvU85)),
and became my [Master's Thesis](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/235457).
