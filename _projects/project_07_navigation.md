Robotics Perception Final Assignment - 2023 <br>
C++ - ROS1 - ROS2 - SLAM <br>
Implemented C++ ROS1 code to estimate the odometry of an autonomous shuttle from wheels encoders, based on real recorded data.
Mapped the laboratory using recorded LIDAR + odometry data, using gmapping.
Imported the map in a stage simulator and performed autonomous watpoint navigation.
Studied and tested from external udemy course the Navigation Stack for ROS2."
