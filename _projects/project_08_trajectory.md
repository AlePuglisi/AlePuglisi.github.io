Control of Mobile Robot Final Assignment - 2023 <br>
C++ - ROS1 - Simulation  <br>
Simulated a car-like (ackerman) robot with the simplified bicycle model, using ROS1 and a custom C++ numerical simulation (with odeint).
Analyzed the simulation with a simple kinematic or a complete dynamic model, designed and tuned a 
feedback linearization with PI jectory tracking controller.
Implemented the trajectory generator and the controller in C++."
