Modeled and simulated the 'Carrelli 1928' tram of Milan with MATLAB-Simulink, focusing on its DC 
(separately excited) motor dynamics. Designed and tuned a suitable speed controller,
given the track specifications.
Analyzed the performance with different external disturbances (slopes)."

Final assignment of a course on [Dynamics of Electrical Machines and Drives](https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?&evn_default=evento&c_classe=837862&__pj0=0&__pj1=52cb81e9c76fcd372f5858307a2f494a). 

In this project, I developed **MATLAB** and **Simulink** software to simulate and control the **DC Separately Excited Motor** used in the original "Carrelli 1928" Tram of Milan. 

Given the datasheet of the motor and other characteristics of the system to control:
- Derived the Motor Design parameters, for modeling purposes.
- Designed speed and current control loop, to cover a specific track. 
- Simulated the system and analyzed the controller performances.
