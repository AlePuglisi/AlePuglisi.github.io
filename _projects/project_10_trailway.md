Dynamics of Electrical Machine and Drives Final Assignment - 2022 <br>
MATLAB - Simulink - PID Control <br>
Modeled and simulated the 'Carrelli 1928' tram of Milan with MATLAB-Simulink, focusing on its DC 
(separately excited) motor dynamics. Designed and tuned a suitable speed controller,
given the track specifications.
Analyzed the performance with different external disturbances (slopes)."
