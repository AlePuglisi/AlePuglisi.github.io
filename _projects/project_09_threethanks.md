Networked Control Final Assignment - 2023 <br>
MATLAB - YALMIP - Simulation <br>
Modeled a benchmark control problem of a three tanks system in MATLAB, and analyzed its stability in 
continuous and discrete time. Tuned different control structures (centralized, decentralized, discontinuous)
through Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) theory and YALMIP optimization toolbox. "
