Hardware Interface Project - 2025 <br>
C++ - ROS2 - Sensor Driver <br>
Developed a ROS2 C++ driver for the recent blueprint oculus M3000d imaging sonar
(from official M3000d sdk and M1200d ENSTA driver).
Integrated additional acoustic processing on raw sonar data. 
Implemented accurate representation conversion (polar to cartesian)
and point cloud broadcasting.
Tested sonar internal AHRS and pressure sensors. 
Other features are under development-testing based on our needs. "
