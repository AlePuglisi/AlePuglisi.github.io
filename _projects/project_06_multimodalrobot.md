Research at the Space Robotics Lab - 2024 <br>
C++ - ROS2 - Gazebo <br>
Implemented and tested novel motion algorithms on a prototype multi-locomotion limbed robot. 
Updated the ROS2 joint control software for the new-end effector module. 
Updated the Gazebo simulation with the new robot components, and fine tuned its dynamic parameters.
Proposed a new stable locomotion-mode transition algorihtm. 
Fine tuned the servo motors controllers and tested the algorithms on the real system."
