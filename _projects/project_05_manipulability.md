Master Thesis - 2025 <br>
C++ - MATLAB - ROS2 - Gazebo <br>
Proposed and Implemented a novel index of dexterity for multi-limbed systems in MATLAB (robotics-toolbox).
Validated the index on a bioinspired example.
Optimized and tested the previously proposed motion sequence with the novel index. 
Upgraded the Gazebo simulation, and integrated the complete transformable gripper-wheel module.
Implemented and tuned custom joint controllers in C++."
