Proposed and Implemented a novel index of dexterity for multi-limbed systems in MATLAB (robotics-toolbox).
Validated the index on a bioinspired example.
Optimized and tested the previously proposed motion sequence with the novel index. 
Upgraded the Gazebo simulation, and integrated the complete transformable gripper-wheel module.
Implemented and tuned custom joint controllers in C++."

Improvement of the research done at the SRL (Tohoku University, JP).
This project is a direct continuation of the work on the 4-Limbed exploration robot. 
The combination of the two projects become my Master's Thesis.

**Summary**:
- Researched performance indices to characterize the maneuverability efficiency of limbed robots, defining a novel theory on dexterity.
- Defined kinematic/dynamic leg description in Denavit‐Hartemberg convention, based on mechanics theory and homogeneous transformations, using MATLAB robotics‐toolbox.
- Developed softwarefor closed‐loop control of motors, and visualized novel ”base manipulability ellipsoid”, using MATLAB and Simulink.
- Proved the reliability of performance criteria, with nature‐inspired comparison using insect kinematics.

**Short List of Results**:
- Derived a dynamic model of the robot in MATLAB.
- Improved joint controllers' performance with model-based tuning.
- Redefined limb model with the Denavit-Hartenberg convention.
- MATLAB and Simulink analysis of joint controllers.
- Developed new performance indices, to validate legged robot maneuverability.
- Used novel indices to improve previously defined motion algorithms.
- Enhanced simulation, and migrated to new Gazebo sim.
- Tested driving motion with wheels and walking motion with grippers.
- Analyzed possible hardware improvements.
